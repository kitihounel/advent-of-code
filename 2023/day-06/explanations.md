Let $L$ be the duration of a race and $R$ the record associated with it.

The distance the boat can travel if we press the button during $t$ milliseconds is: $D = (L - t) * t = -t^2 + L*t$. 

We want to find all $t$ such that $-t^2 + L*t \gt R$.

We have to solve the equation $(E): -t^2 + L*t - R = 0$.

If $\delta \gt 0$ the equation has two roots $t_1$ and $t_2$. We are interessed by the values of $t$ with the range $]t_1, t_2[$.
We know that because the sign of $-t^2 + L*t - R$ is the opposite of the sign of coefficient of $t^2$ (which is $-1$).
